[Settings]

# If the phone has more than one SIM slot, the 3G/LTE module may be
# shared by all modems, meaning that only one of the slots can use
# 3G/LTE. In order to "hand 4G over" to the other slot, the modem
# currently using 3G/LTE has to drop to GSM, release 3G/LTE module
# and only then 3G/LTE can be used by the other modem. This setting
# allows to disable this behaviour (say, if your phone has independent
# 3G/LTE modules for each slot or you don't need 4G for both slots).
# Obviously, it only has any effect if you have more than one SIM.
#
# Default is true (switch the current data modem to 2G when changing
# the data modems)

# Not sent by default.

# RIL_REQUEST_SET_UICC_SUBSCRIPTION is 115 in RIL version 9 (or earlier)
# and 122 in RIL version 10 and later. Since ofono doesn't know in advance
# which RIL version it's dealing with, it makes the decision at runtime.
# Settings it to false disables the workaround and always sends 122.

# Default is true (select SET_UICC_SUBSCRIPTION based on the RIL version)
